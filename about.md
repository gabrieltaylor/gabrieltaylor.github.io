<p>Hello friend!<br/>My name's Gabriel and I'm a web developer in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p>I work primarily with Python and Ruby, but I also immensely enjoy exploring the unfamiliar; languages like Java and Elixir, and frameworks like Node.js and React.js.</p>
<p>This blog is where I share things I've learned and beautiful code I've read. I hope you find it useful.</p>
